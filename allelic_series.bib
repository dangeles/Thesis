It has become increasingly clear over the past two decades that knowledge from one organism, even one so simple as a worm, can provide tremendous power when connected with knowledge from other organisms. And because of the experimental accessibility of nematodes, knowledge about worms can come more quickly and cheaply than knowledge about higher organisms.},

abstract = {Mediator complexes are large multiprotein assemblies that function in the regulation of eukaryotic gene transcription. In yeast, certain mediator subunits appear to comprise a subcomplex that acts in the regulation of a specific subset of genes. We investigated in a metazoan, Caenorhabditis elegans, the roles and interactions of two of those subunits, CeTRAP240/let-19 and CeTRAP230/dpy-22. We found that CeTRAP240/let-19 contains four domains that are conserved in the human TRAP240 protein and that one of those domains displays intrinsic transcriptional repression activity. Using RNA interference, we found that reduced expression of CeTRAP240/let-19 displayed a high penetrance of embryonic lethality in F1 progeny; animals that escaped embryonic arrest showed mutant phenotypes such as burst vulva and molting defects. CeTRAP240/let-19 appeared to affect specific genes, as CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi) led to selectively reduced expression of a subset of reporter genes examined. Genetic experiments supported the view that CeTRAP240/let-19 and CeTRAP230/dpy-22, like their Drosophila and yeast counterparts, can operate on common pathways. Thus, a male tail phenotype caused by the pal-1(e2091) mutation was suppressed not only by CeTRAP230/dpy-22 mutants, as reported previously, but also by reduced expression of CeTRAP240/let-19. Additionally, CeTRAP240/let-19(RNAi) in a CeTRAP230/dpy-22 mutant background produced a strong synthetic lethal phenotype. Overall, our results establish specific roles of CeTRAP240/let-19 in C. elegans embryonic development and a functional interaction between CeTRAP240/let-19 and CeTRAP230/dpy-22. Interestingly, whereas this interaction has been conserved from yeast to mammals, the subcomplex modulates metazoan-specific genetic pathways, likely in addition to those also controlled in yeast.},

abstract = {Genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screening is a very powerful tool for analyzing gene function in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans. The effectiveness of RNAi varies from gene to gene, however, and neuronally expressed genes are largely refractive to RNAi in wild-type worms. We found that C. elegans strains carrying mutations in lin-35, the worm ortholog of the tumor suppressor gene p105Rb, or a subset of the genetically related synMuv B family of chromatin-modifying genes, show increased strength and penetrance for many germline, embryonic, and post-embryonic RNAi phenotypes, including neuronal RNAi phenotypes. Mutations in these same genes also enhance somatic transgene silencing via an RNAi-dependent mechanism. Two genes, mes-4 and zfp-1, are required both for the vulval lineage defects resulting from mutations in synMuv B genes and for RNAi, suggesting a common mechanism for the function of synMuv B genes in vulval development and in regulating RNAi. Enhanced RNAi in the germline of lin-35 worms suggests that misexpression of germline genes in somatic cells cannot alone account for the enhanced RNAi observed in this strain. A worm strain with a null mutation in lin-35 is more sensitive to RNAi than any other previously described single mutant strain, and so will prove very useful for future genome-wide RNAi screens, particularly for identifying genes with neuronal functions. As lin-35 is the worm ortholog of the mammalian tumor suppressor gene p105Rb, misregulation of RNAi may be important during human oncogenesis.},

abstract = {In C. elegans, the epithelial Pn.p cells adopt either a vulval precursor cell fate or fuse with the surrounding hypodermis (the F fate). Our results suggest that a Wnt signal transduced through a pathway involving the beta-catenin homolog BAR-1 controls whether P3.p through P8.p adopt the vulval precursor cell fate. In bar-1 mutants, P3.p through P8.p can adopt F fates instead of vulval precursor cell fates. The Wnt/bar-1 signaling pathway acts by regulating the expression of the Hox gene lin-39, since bar-1 is required for LIN-39 expression and forced lin-39 expression rescues the bar-1 mutant phenotype. LIN-39 activity is also regulated by the anchor cell signal/let-23 receptor tyrosine kinase/let-60 Ras signaling pathway. Our genetic and molecular experiments show that the vulval precursor cells can integrate the input from the BAR-1 and LET-60 Ras signaling pathways by coordinately regulating activity of the common target LIN-39 Hox.},

abstract = {MED12: is a member of the large Mediator complex, which has a critical and central role in RNA polymerase II transcription. As a multiprotien complex, Mediator regulates signals involved in cell growth, development, and differentiation, and it is involved in a protein network required for extraneuronal gene silencing and also functions as a direct suppressor of Gli3-dependent Sonic hedgehog signaling. This may explain its role in several different X-linked intellectual disability syndromes that share some overlapping clinical features. This review will compare and contrast four different clinical conditions that have been associated with different mutations in MED12, which is located at Xq13. To date, these conditions include Opitz-Kaveggia (FG) syndrome, Lujan syndrome, Ohdo syndrome (Maat-Kievit-Brunner type, or OSMKB), and one large family with profound X-linked intellectual disability due to a novel c.5898insC frameshift mutation that unlike the other three syndromes, resulted in affected female carriers and truncation of the MED12 protein. It is likely that more MED12 mutations will be detected in sporadic patients and X-linked families with intellectual disability and dysmorphic features as exome sequencing becomes more commonly utilized, and this overview of MED12-related disorders may help to correlate MED12 genotypes with clinical findings.},

@article{Schwarz2012,
abstract = {In both metazoan development and metastatic cancer, migrating cells must carry out a detailed, complex program of sensing cues, binding substrates, and moving their cytoskeletons. The linker cell in Caenorhabditis elegans males undergoes a stereotyped migration that guides gonad organogenesis, occurs with precise timing, and requires the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-67. To better understand how this occurs, we performed RNA-seq of individually staged and dissected linker cells, comparing transcriptomes from linker cells of third-stage (L3) larvae, fourth-stage (L4) larvae, and nhr-67-RNAi-treated L4 larvae. We observed expression of 8,000-10,000 genes in the linker cell, 22-25{\%} of which were up- or down-regulated 20-fold during development by NHR-67. Of genes that we tested by RNAi, 22{\%} (45 of 204) were required for normal shape and migration, suggesting that many NHR-67-dependent, linker cell-enriched genes play roles in this migration. One unexpected class of genes up-regulated by NHR-67 was tandem pore potassium channels, which are required for normal linker-cell migration. We also found phenotypes for genes with human orthologs but no previously described migratory function. Our results provide an extensive catalog of genes that act in a migrating cell, identify unique molecular functions involved in nematode cell migration, and suggest similar functions in humans.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

We developed a single coefficient to quantify transcriptome-wide epistasis that reflects the underlying interactions and which can be interpreted intuitively. To demonstrate our approach, we sequenced four single and two double mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans From these mutants, we reconstructed the known hypoxia pathway. In addition, we uncovered a class of 56 genes with HIF-1-dependent expression that have opposite changes in expression in mutants of two genes that cooperate to negatively regulate HIF-1 abundance; however, the double mutant of these genes exhibits suppression epistasis. This class violates the classical model of HIF-1 regulation but can be explained by postulating a role of hydroxylated HIF-1 in transcriptional control.},

abstract = {We describe two classes of mutations in the lin-12 locus of the nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis~elegans}. Ten semidominant mutations (lin-12[d]) appear to elevate the level of lin-12 activity. Thirty-two recessive alleles (lin-12[0]), including two amber mutations, appear to eliminate gene activity. The lin-12(d) and lin-12(0) mutations result in reciprocal homeotic transformations in the fates of defined cells in several different tissues. Gene dosage studies suggest that a high level of lin-12 activity specifies one cell fate and a low level specifies an alternative fate. Temperature-shift experiments indicate that lin-12 acts at the time cell fate is determined in wild type. We propose that lin-12 functions as a binary switch to control decisions between alternative cell fates during \emph{C.~elegans} development. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {The let-23 gene, which encodes a putative tyrosine kinase of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor subfamily, has multiple functions during \emph{Caenorhabditis~elegans} development. We show that let-23 function is required for vulval precursor cells (VPCs) to respond to the signal that induces vulval differentiation: a complete loss of let-23 function results in no induction. However, some let-23 mutations that genetically reduce but do not eliminate let-23 function result in VPCs apparently hypersensitive to inductive signal: as many as five of six VPCs can adopt vulval fates, in contrast to the three that normally do. These results suggest that the let-23 receptor tyrosine kinase controls two opposing pathways, one that stimulates vulval differentiation and another that negatively regulates vulval differentiation. Furthermore, analysis of 16 new let-23 mutations indicates that the let-23 kinase functions in at least five tissues. Since various let-23 mutant phenotypes can be obtained independently, the let-23 gene is likely to have tissue-specific functions.},

abstract = {Signaling proteins display remarkable cell-to-cell heterogeneity in their dynamic responses to stimuli, but the consequences of this heterogeneity remain largely unknown. For instance, the contribution of the dynamics of the innate immune transcription factor nuclear factor $\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) to gene expression output is disputed. Here we explore these questions by integrating live-cell imaging approaches with single-cell sequencing technologies. We used this approach to measure both the dynamics of lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-$\kappa$B activation and the global transcriptional response in the same individual cell. Our results identify multiple, distinct cytokine expression patterns that are correlated with NF-$\kappa$B activation dynamics, establishing a functional role for NF-$\kappa$B dynamics in determining cellular phenotypes. Applications of this approach to other model systems and single-cell sequencing technologies have significant potential for discovery, as it is now possible to trace cellular behavior from the initial stimulus, through the signaling pathways, down to genome-wide changes in gene expression, all inside of a single cell.},

Microarray structure-function analysis of S. cerevisiae Mediator reveals functional antagonism between the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) submodule and components from the Tail (Med15, Med2, Med3), Head (Med20, Med18), and Middle (Med31). Certain genes exhibit increased or decreased expression, depending on which subunit is deleted. Epistasis analysis with expression-profile phenotypes shows that MED2 and MED18 are downstream of CDK8. Strikingly, Cdk8-mediated modification of a single amino acid within Mediator represses the regulon of a single transcription factor, Rcs1/Aft1. Highly specific gene regulation is thought to be determined by activators and combinatorial use of cofactors. Here, subtle modification of the general transcription machinery through one of its own components is shown to determine highly specific expression patterns. Expression profiling can therefore precisely map regulatory cascades, and our findings support a role for Mediator as a direct processor of signaling pathways for determining specificity.},

abstract = {Mediator is an essential, large, multisubunit, transcriptional co-activator highly conserved across eukaryotes. Mediator interacts with gene-specific transcription factors at enhancers as well as with the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription machinery bound at promoters. It also interacts with several other factors involved in various aspects of transcription, chromatin regulation, and mRNA processing. Hence, Mediator is at the nexus of RNAPII transcription, regulating its many steps and connecting transcription with co-transcriptional events. To achieve this flexible role, Mediator, which is divided into several functional modules, reorganizes its conformation and composition while making transient contacts with other components. Here, we review the mechanisms of action of Mediator and propose a unifying model for its function. Mediator is implicated in most aspects of gene expression, including nearly all steps of the transcription reaction, in addition to mRNA processing, higher-order chromatin organization, and genome stability.The dynamic composition and structure of Mediator have recently begun to be elucidated through both structural work and in vivo protein-DNA interaction mapping.The Kinase module has both positive and negative roles in gene expression regulation.},

abstract = {Background: Mapping of orthologous genes among species serves an important role in functional genomics by allowing researchers to develop hypotheses about gene function in one species based on what is known about the functions of orthologs in other species. Several tools for predicting orthologous gene relationships are available. However, these tools can give different results and identification of predicted orthologs is not always straightforward. Results: We report a simple but effective tool, the Drosophila RNAi Screening Center Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT; http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt), for rapid identification of orthologs. DIOPT integrates existing approaches, facilitating rapid identification of orthologs among human, mouse, zebrafish, \emph{C.~elegans}, Drosophila, and S. cerevisiae. As compared to individual tools, DIOPT shows increased sensitivity with only a modest decrease in specificity. Moreover, the flexibility built into the DIOPT graphical user interface allows researchers with different goals to appropriately 'cast a wide net' or limit results to highest confidence predictions. DIOPT also displays protein and domain alignments, including percent amino acid identity, for predicted ortholog pairs. This helps users identify the most appropriate matches among multiple possible orthologs. To facilitate using model organisms for functional analysis of human disease-associated genes, we used DIOPT to predict high-confidence orthologs of disease genes in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and genes in genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets. The results are accessible through the DIOPT diseases and traits query tool (DIOPT-DIST; http://www.flyrnai.org/diopt-dist). Conclusions: DIOPT and DIOPT-DIST are useful resources for researchers working with model organisms, especially those who are interested in exploiting model organisms such as Drosophila to study the functions of human disease genes.

Assessment of sequencing performance and library quality is critical to the interpretation of RNA-seq data, yet few tools exist to address this issue. We introduce RNA-SeQC, a program which provides key measures of data quality. These metrics include yield, alignment and duplication rates; GC bias, rRNA content, regions of alignment (exon, intron and intragenic), continuity of coverage, 3′/5′ bias and count of detectable transcripts, among others. The software provides multi-sample evaluation of library construction protocols, input materials and other experimental parameters. The modularity of the software enables pipeline integration and the routine monitoring of key measures of data quality such as the number of alignable reads, duplication rates and rRNA contamination. RNA-SeQC allows investigators to make informed decisions about sample inclusion in downstream analysis.

Differential analysis of RNA-seq experiments requires careful assessment of gene expression variability from a few replicate samples to identify biologically relevant expression differences between conditions 6 . There is ongoing debate on even basic questions such as how to measure gene abundances 1 , whether there is sufficient power to test for differences in abundance of individual isoforms 7 , and how to best utilize biological replicates 1 . Part of the reason for this uncertainty is the lack of agreed-upon standards for testing and benchmark-ing RNA-seq methods. In most cases, accuracy claims are based on simulations of read counts from distributions assumed in the models, rather than on simulations of raw reads 2,5,6,8,9 . Such read-count-based simulations typically discount the effects of ambigu-ously mapping reads and fail to capture both the possibilities for and challenges of isoform-specific differential analysis. Here we describe a novel approach to RNA-seq differential analysis and a comprehensive benchmarking framework with broader scale and scope than have previously been published. Our approach is implemented along with interactive visualization software that provides crucial transparency in assessing results, and it offers users a convenient tool for exploratory data analysis. Throughout the paper we use the name 'sleuth' to refer to both our statistical method and the software application. sleuth relies on variance decomposition to identify biologi-cal differences in transcript or gene expression (Fig. 1). While using a standard strategy of shrinkage to stabilize variance estimates from few samples 2,6 , sleuth is able to leverage recent advances in quantification 10 to obtain error estimates that can be used to decouple biological variance from inferential vari-ance before shrinkage (Fig. 1a). Variance decomposition is important because of the diversity of variance estimates across genes that arise when quantifying abundances. In one example (Fig. 1b,c), DESeq2 and voom were run on the same data with featureCounts summaries, and these tools identified a gene as differentially expressed at a false discovery rate (FDR) thresh-old of 0.10 (reported FDR 8.81 × 10 −21 and 5.56 × 10 −10 , respec-tively); whereas sleuth did not find differences between conditions to be significant (reported FDR 0.156) because of the high infer-ential variance. Some methods have attempted to utilize estimates of quantification errors 6,11,12 , but these methods are limited by long run times and lack of robustness to ambiguously mapping reads. By leveraging kallisto's 10 rapid quantification and variance estimation, sleuth overcomes these issues and provides a statistically rigorous, flexible, and efficient tool for RNA-seq analysis. To test its performance, we compared sleuth with other widely used methods on both simulated and biological data. Our simu-lation was based on two experimental conditions with three replicates each (see Online Methods). We simulated biological variance (dispersion) according to the negative binomial count model used by DESeq2 (ref. 9). To accurately assess perform-ance, each simulation was repeated 20 times. All programs except sleuth used quantifications inferred from genome alignments (see Online Methods). Full details of the simulation experiments are in Supplementary Note 1. sleuth displayed higher sensitivity than Cuffdiff 2 (ref. 12), DESeq 6 , DESeq2 (ref. 9), EBSeq 7 , edgeR 8 , voom 2 ; and sleuth dis-played log-fold change 13 in the FDR range of usual interest (0–10{\%}) and beyond, up to FDR 0.3 (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2; and Supplementary Note 1). As expected, our simulations found that DESeq2 has more power than DESeq at all relevant FDRs, and that the na{\"{i}}ve ranking of genes by log-fold change produces poor results. To control for the effect of different filtering strategies, we ran all programs on a common filtered set of genes and showed that sleuth maintains its sensitivity advantage (Supplementary Note 1). Finally, to show the benefit of directly estimating infer-ential variance, we also demonstrated that sleuth outperforms models in which inferential variance is assumed to be Poisson or zero (Supplementary Note 1). Since FDR control is fundamental for identifying differentially expressed genes in experiments with few replicates, we carefully},

@article{Perez2007,
abstract = {T he backbone of scientific computing is mostly a collection of high-perfor-mance code written in Fortran, C, and C++ that typically runs in batch mode on large systems, clusters, and supercomputers. However, over the past decade, high-level environ-ments that integrate easy-to-use interpreted lan-guages, comprehensive numerical libraries, and visualization facilities have become extremely popu-lar in this field. As hardware becomes faster, the crit-ical bottleneck in scientific computing isn't always the computer's processing time; the scientist's time is also a consideration. For this reason, systems that allow rapid algorithmic exploration, data analysis, and vi-sualization have become a staple of daily scientific work. The Interactive Data Language (IDL) and Matlab (for numerical work), and Mathematica and Maple (for work that includes symbolic manipula-tion) are well-known commercial environments of this kind. GNU Data Language, Octave, Maxima and Sage provide their open source counterparts. All these systems offer an interactive command line in which code can be run immediately, without having to go through the traditional edit/com-pile/execute cycle. This flexible style matches well the spirit of computing in a scientific context, in which determining what computations must be performed next often requires significant work. An interactive environment lets scientists look at data, test new ideas, combine algorithmic approaches, and evaluate their outcome directly. This process might lead to a final result, or it might clarify how they need to build a more static, large-scale pro-duction code. As this article shows, Python (www.python.org) is an excellent tool for such a workflow. 1 The IPython project (http://ipython.scipy.org) aims to not only provide a greatly enhanced Python shell but also facilities for interactive distributed and par-allel computing, as well as a comprehensive set of tools for building special-purpose interactive envi-ronments for scientific computing.},

We identified two loss-of-function mutations in dpy-22, previously cloned as sop-1, that promote the ability of activated LET-23 to induce ectopic vulval fates. DPY-22 is a glutamine-rich protein that is most similar to human TRAP230, a component of a transcriptional mediator complex. DPY-22 has previously been shown to regulate WNT responses through inhibition of the beta-catenin-like protein BAR-1. We provide evidence that DPY-22 also inhibits RAS-dependent vulval fate specification independently of BAR-1, and probably regulates the activities of multiple transcription factors during development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that although inhibition of BAR-1-dependent gene expression has been shown to require the C-terminal glutamine-rich region, this region is dispensable for inhibition of RAS-dependent cell differentiation. Thus, the glutamine-rich region contributes to specificity of this class of mediator protein.},

Taken together, these findings lead to the suggestion that Mediator is required for basal RNA polymerase II transcription in vivo.

abstract = {The human CDK8 subcomplex (CDK8, cyclin C, Med12, and Med13) negatively regulates transcription in ways not completely defined; past studies suggested CDK8 kinase activity was required for its repressive function. Using a reconstituted transcription system together with recombinant or endogenous CDK8 subcomplexes, we demonstrate that, in fact, Med12 and Med13 are critical for subcomplex-dependent repression, whereas CDK8 kinase activity is not. A hallmark of activated transcription is efficient reinitiation from promoter-bound scaffold complexes that recruit a series of pol II enzymes to the gene. Notably, the CDK8 submodule strongly represses even reinitiation events, suggesting a means to fine tune transcript levels. Structural and biochemical studies confirm the CDK8 submodule binds the Mediator leg/tail domain via the Med13 subunit, and this submodule-Mediator association precludes pol II recruitment. Collectively, these results reveal the CDK8 subcomplex functions as a simple switch that controls the Mediator-pol II interaction to help regulate transcription initiation and reinitiation events. As Mediator is generally required for expression of protein-coding genes, this may reflect a common mechanism by which activated transcription is shut down in human cells.},

Here, we review the current knowledge of Mediator subunit function in the nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis~elegans}, a metazoan in which established and emerging genetic technologies facilitate the study of developmental and physiological regulation in vivo. In this nematode, unbiased genetic screens have revealed critical roles for Mediator components in core developmental pathways such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling. More recently, important roles for \emph{C.~elegans} Mediator subunits have emerged in the regulation of lipid metabolism and of systemic stress responses, engaging conserved transcription factors such as nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs). We emphasize instances where similar functions for individual Mediator subunits exist in mammals, highlighting parallels between Mediator subunit action in nematode development and in human cancer biology. We also discuss a parallel between the association of the Mediator subunit MED12 with several human disorders and the role of its \emph{C.~elegans} ortholog mdt-12 as a regulatory hub that interacts with numerous signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Over half of the neurons in \emph{Caenorhabditis~elegans} send axons to the nerve ring, a large neuropil in the head of the animal. Genetic screens in animals that express the green fluorescent protein in a subset of sensory neurons identified eight new sax genes that affect the morphology of nerve ring axons. sax-3/robo mutations disrupt axon guidance in the nerve ring, while sax-5, sax-9 and unc-44 disrupt both axon guidance and axon extension. Axon extension and guidance proceed normally in sax-1, sax-2, sax-6, sax-7 and sax-8 mutants, but these animals exhibit later defects in the maintenance of nerve ring structure. The functions of existing guidance genes in nerve ring development were also examined, revealing that SAX-3/Robo acts in parallel to the VAB-1/Eph receptor and the UNC-6/netrin, UNC-40/DCC guidance systems for ventral guidance of axons in the amphid commissure, a major route of axon entry into the nerve ring. In addition, SAX-3/Robo and the VAB-1/Eph receptor both function to prevent aberrant axon crossing at the ventral midline. Together, these genes define pathways required for axon growth, guidance and maintenance during nervous system development.},

abstract = {The let-60 gene of  \emph{Caenorhabditis~elegans} controls the choice between vulval and hypodermal differentiation in response to an inductive signal from the gonad. let-60 encodes a ras protein that acts downstream of the let-23 receptor tyrosine kinase in a signal transduction pathway. Dominant-negative mutations of let-60 [let-60(dn)] cause a reduction of the gene activity in let-60(dn)/+ heterozygotes and a vulva-less mutant phenotype. We have found that nine let-60(dn) mutations cause replacements of conserved residues. Four are in two novel positions; others are in positions known previously to cause dominant-negative mutations in mammalian cells. The locations of these lesions suggest that they disrupt the ability of the ras protein to bind guanine nucleotides. Four let-60(dn) mutant genes were introduced into wild-type animals in the form of extrachromosomal arrays and were found to generate three dominant phenotypes--lethality, vulva-less, or multivulva--depending on gene dose and alleles. The dominant lethality caused by high-dose transgenic let-60(dn) genes suggests a toxic effect of these mutant genes in early development. The dominant-negative effects of these mutations in heterozygotes are likely to be caused by competition between let-60(dn) and let-60(+) protein for a positive regulator. All let-60(dn) mutations interfere with let-60(+) activity, but some alleles have partial constitutive activity, suggesting that the ability to interact with the activator is separable from the ability to exert a physiological effect (stimulation of vulval differentiation). These dn mutations might be useful for interfering with ras-mediated signal transduction pathways in other multicellular organisms.},

We report here the molecular characterization of the lin-15 locus. The two lin-15 activities are encoded by contiguous genomic regions and by two distinct, non-overlapping transcripts that may be processed from a single mRNA precursor by trans-splicing. Based on the DNA sequence, the 719- and 1,440-amino acid lin-15 proteins are not similar to each other or to known proteins. lin-15 multivulva mutants, which are defective in both lin-15 activities, contain deletions and insertions that affect the lin-15 genomic region.},

abstract = {Genetic screens for modifiers of activated Ras phenotypes have identified a novel protein, kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), which shares significant sequence homology with Raf family protein kinases. Studies using Drosophila melanogaster and  \emph{Caenorhabditis~elegans} predict that KSR positively regulates Ras signaling; however, the function of mammalian KSR is not well understood. We show here that two predicted kinase-dead mutants of KSR retain the ability to complement ksr-1 loss-of-function alleles in \emph{C.~elegans} , suggesting that KSR may have physiological, kinase-independent functions. Furthermore, we observe that murine KSR forms a multimolecular signaling complex in human embryonic kidney 293T cells composed of HSP90, HSP70, HSP68, p50(CDC37), MEK1, MEK2, 14-3-3, and several other, unidentified proteins. Treatment of cells with geldanamycin, an inhibitor of HSP90, decreases the half-life of KSR, suggesting that HSPs may serve to stabilize KSR. Both nematode and mammalian KSRs are capable of binding to MEKs, and three-point mutants of KSR, corresponding to \emph{C.~elegans}  loss-of-function alleles, are specifically compromised in MEK binding. KSR did not alter MEK activity or activation. However, KSR-MEK binding shifts the apparent molecular mass of MEK from 44 to {\textgreater}700 kDa, and this results in the appearance of MEK in membrane-associated fractions. Together, these results suggest that KSR may act as a scaffolding protein for the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.},

Consistent with its negative function, overexpressing sur-5 from an extragenic array partially suppresses the Multivulva phenotype of an activated let-60 ras mutation and causes synergistic phenotypes with a lin-45 raf mutation. We have cloned sur-5 and shown that it encodes a novel protein. We have also identified a potential mammalian SUR-5 homolog that is about 35{\%} identical to the worm protein. SUR-5 also has some sequence similarity to acetyl coenzyme A synthetases and is predicted to contain ATP/GTP and AMP binding sites.

Animals homozygous for mek-2(h294) exhibited a highly penetrant sterile and Vulvaless phenotype. Microinjection of a gain-of-function mek-2 mutation resulted in Muv and other mutant phenotypes, whereas microinjection of a dominant-negative mutation not only suppressed the Muv phenotype of an activated let-60 ras mutation but also caused an egg-laying defective phenotype in otherwise wild type animals.

It has been suspected that dimeric Ras may promote dimerization and activation of Raf. Here, we show that the GTP-bound catalytic domain of K-Ras4B, a highly oncogenic splice variant of the K-Ras isoform, forms stable homodimers. We observe two major dimer interfaces. The first, highly populated $\beta$-sheet dimer interface is at the Switch I and effector binding regions, overlapping the binding surfaces of Raf, PI3K, RalGDS, and additional effectors. This interface has to be inhibitory to such effectors. The second, helical interface also overlaps the binding sites of some effectors. This interface may promote activation of Raf. Our data reveal how Ras self-association can regulate effector binding and activity, and suggest that disruption of the helical dimer interface by drugs may abate Raf signaling in cancer.},

abstract = {During induction of the  \emph{Caenorhabditis~elegans} hermaphrodite vulva by the anchor cell of the gonad, six multipotent vulval precursor cells (VPCs) have two distinct fates: three VPCs generate the vulva and the other three VPCs generate nonspecialized hypodermis. Genes that control the fates of the VPCs in response to the anchor cell signal are defined by mutations that cause all six VPCs to generate vulval tissue (Multivulva or Muv) or that cause all six VPCs to generate hypodermis (Vulvaless or Vul). Seven dominant Vul mutations were isolated as dominant suppressors of a lin-15 Muv mutation. These mutations are dominant alleles of the gene let-60, previously identified only by recessive lethal mutations. Our genetic studies of these dominant Vul recessive lethal mutations, recessive lethal mutations, intragenic revertants of the dominant Vul mutations, and the closely mapping semi-dominant multivulva lin-34 mutations suggest that: (1) loss-of-function mutations of let-60 are recessive lethal at a larval stage, but they also cause a Vul phenotype if the lethality is rescued maternally by a lin-34 gain-of-function mutation. (2) The dominant Vul alleles of let-60 are dominant negative mutations whose gene products compete with wild-type activity. (3) lin-34 semidominant Muv alleles are either gain-of-function mutations of let-60 or gain-of-function mutations of an intimately related gene that elevates let-60 activity. We propose that let-60 activity controls VPC fates. In a wild-type animal, reception by a VPC of inductive signal activates let-60, and it generates into a vulval cell type; in absence of inductive signal, let-60 activity is low and the VPC generates hypodermal cells. Our genetic interaction studies suggest that let-60 acts downstream of let-23 and lin-15 and upstream of lin-1 and lin-12 in the genetic pathway specifying the switch between vulval and nonvulval cell types.},

Furthermore, a spatial EGF gradient, in addition to inducing 1° fate, directly contributes to 2° fate via an unknown pathway. We find that in addition to its canonical effector, Raf, vulval Ras utilizes an exchange factor for the Ral small GTPase (RalGEF), such that Ras-RalGEF-Ral antagonizes Ras-Raf pro-1° fate activity. Consistent with its restricted expression pattern, Ral participates in EGF pro-2° activity. Thus, we have delineated a Ras effector-switching mechanism whereby position within the morphogen gradient dictates that Ras effector usage is switched to RalGEF from Raf to promote 2° instead of 1° fate. Our observations define the utility of Ras effector switching during normal development and may provide a possible mechanistic basis for cell and cancer-type differences in effector dependency and activation.},

Here, we show that, contrary the current model, lin-1 is required positively for the proper expression of several genes regulated by the pathway in cells adopting the 1° cell fate. We show that the positive requirement for lin-1 is downstream of let-60 Ras and mpk-1 MAP kinase, and that it has a focus in the vulval precursor cells themselves. lin-1 alleles encoding proteins lacking a docking site for MPK-1 MAP kinase are defective in the positive function. We also show that lin-1 apparently has both positive and negative functions during the specification of the fates of other cells in the worm requiring Ras/MAP kinase signaling.},

abstract = {In  \emph{Caenorhabditis~elegans}  , Ras/ERK and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways cooperate to induce P12 and vulval cell fates in a Hox-dependent manner. Here we describe eor-1 and eor-2, two new positively acting nuclear components of the Ras and Wnt pathways. eor-1 and eor-2 act downstream or in parallel to ERK and function redundantly with the Mediator complex gene sur-2 and the functionally related gene lin-25, such that removal of both eor-1/eor-2 and sur-2/lin-25 mimics the removal of a main Ras pathway component. Furthermore, the eor-1 and eor-2 mutant backgrounds reveal an essential role for the Elk1-related gene lin-1. eor-1 and eor-2 also act downstream or in parallel to pry-1 Axin and therefore act at the convergence of the Ras and Wnt pathways. eor-1 encodes the ortholog of human PLZF, a BTB/zinc-finger transcription factor that is fused to RARalpha in acute promyelocytic leukemia. eor-2 encodes a novel protein. EOR-1/PLZF and EOR-2 appear to function closely together and cooperate with Hox genes to promote the expression of Ras- and Wnt-responsive genes. Further studies of eor-1 and eor-2 may provide insight into the roles of PLZF in normal development and leukemogenesis.},

abstract = {We are using  \emph{Caenorhabditis~elegans} vulval induction to study intercellular signaling and its regulation. Genes required for vulval induction include the LIN-3 transforming alpha-like growth factor, the LET-23 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-receptor-like transmembrane tyrosine kinase, the SEM-5 adaptor protein, LET-60 Ras, and the LIN-45 Raf serine/threonine kinase. Inactivation of this pathway results in a failure of vulval differentiation, the "vulvaless" phenotype. Activation of this pathway either by overexpression of LIN-3, a point mutation in the LET-23 extracellular domain, or hyperactivity of LET-60 Ras results in excessive vulval differentiation, the "multivulva" phenotype. In addition to searching for new genes that act positively in this signaling pathway, we have also characterized genes that negatively regulate this inductive signaling pathway. We find that such negative regulators are functionally redundant: mutation of only one of these negative regulators has no effect on vulval differentiation; however, if particular combinations of these genes are inactivated, excessive vulval differentiation occurs. The LIN-15 locus encodes two functionally redundant products, LIN-15A and LIN-15B, that formally act upstream of the LET-23 receptor to prevent its activity in the absence of inductive signal. The LIN-15A and B proteins are novel and unrelated to each other. The unc-101, sli-1, and rok-1 genes encode a distinct set of negative regulators of vulval differentiation. The unc-101 gene encodes an adaptin, proposed to be involved in intracellular protein trafficking. The sli-1 gene encodes a protein with similarity to c-cbl, a mammalian proto-oncogene not previously linked with a tyrosine kinase-Ras-mediated signaling pathway. LIN-3 and LET-23 are required for several aspects of \emph{C.~elegans}  development--larval viability, P12 neuroectoblast specification, hermaphrodite vulval induction and fertility, and three inductions during male copulatory spicule development. Fertility and vulval differentiation appear to be mediated by distinct parts of the cytoplasmic tail of LET-23, and by distinct signal transduction pathways.},

abstract = {Rat sarcoma (Ras) GTPases regulate cell proliferation and survival through effector pathways including Raf-MAPK, and are the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer. Although it is well established that Ras activity requires binding to both GTP and the membrane, details of how Ras operates on the cell membrane to activate its effectors remain elusive. Efforts to target mutant Ras in human cancers to therapeutic benefit have also been largely unsuccessful. Here we show that Ras-GTP forms dimers to activate MAPK. We used quantitative photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) to analyze the nanoscale spatial organization of PAmCherry1-tagged KRas 4B (hereafter referred to KRas) on the cell membrane under various signaling conditions. We found that at endogenous expression levels KRas forms dimers, and KRas(G12D), a mutant that constitutively binds GTP, activates MAPK. Overexpression of KRas leads to formation of higher order Ras nanoclusters. Conversely, at lower expression levels, KRas(G12D) is monomeric and activates MAPK only when artificially dimerized. Moreover, dimerization and signaling of KRas are both dependent on an intact CAAX (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic; X, any amino acid) motif that is also known to mediate membrane localization. These results reveal a new, dimerization-dependent signaling mechanism of Ras, and suggest Ras dimers as a potential therapeutic target in mutant Ras-driven tumors.},

Here we describe the identification, cloning and genetic characterization of C.ELEGANS: SOS-1, a putative guanine nucleotide exchanger for LET-60 RAS. RNA interference experiments suggest that SOS-1 participates in RAS-dependent signaling events downstream of LET-23 EGFR, EGL-15 FGFR and an unknown RTK. We demonstrate that the previously identified let-341 gene encodes SOS-1. Analyzing vulval development in a let-341 null mutant, we find an SOS-1-independent pathway involved in the activation of RAS signaling. This SOS-1-independent signaling is not inhibited by SLI-1/Cbl and is not mediated by PTP-2/SHP, raising the possibility that there could be another RasGEF.},

Components that mediate EGL-15 signaling have been identified via mutations that confer a Clear (Clr) phenotype, indicative of hyperactivity of this pathway, or a suppressor-of-Clr (Soc) phenotype, indicative of reduced pathway activity. We have isolated a gain-of-function allele of let-60 ras that confers a Clr phenotype and implicated both let-60 ras and components of a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in EGL-15 signaling by their Soc phenotype. Epistasis analysis indicates that the gene soc-1 functions in EGL-15 signaling by acting either upstream of or independently of LET-60 RAS. soc-1 encodes a multisubstrate adaptor protein with an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain that is structurally similar to the DOS protein in Drosophila and mammalian GAB1. DOS is known to act with the cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase Corkscrew (CSW) in signaling pathways in Drosophila. Similarly, the \emph{C.~elegans}  CSW ortholog PTP-2 was found to be involved in EGL-15 signaling. Structure-function analysis of SOC-1 and phenotypic analysis of single and double mutants are consistent with a model in which SOC-1 and PTP-2 act together in a pathway downstream of EGL-15 and the Src homology domain 2 (SH2)/SH3-adaptor protein SEM-5/GRB2 contributes to SOC-1-independent activities of EGL-15.},

abstract = {Although it is well established that Ras requires membrane localization for activation of its target molecule, Raf-1, the reason for this requirement is not fully understood. In this study, we found that modified Ras, which is purified from Sf9 cells, could activate Raf-1 in a cell-free system, when incorporated into liposome. Using a bifunctional cross-linker and a protein-fragmentation complementation assay, we detected dimer formation of Ras in the liposome and in the intact cells, respectively. These results suggest that dimerization of Ras in the lipid membrane is essential for activation of Raf-1. To support this, we found that, when fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST), unprocessed Ras expressed in Escherichia coli could bypass the requirement for liposome. A Ras-dependent Raf-1 activator, which we previously reported (Mizutani, S., Koide, H., and Kaziro, Y. (1998) Oncogene 16, 2781-2786), was still required for Raf-1 activation by GST-Ras. Furthermore, an enforced dimerization of unmodified oncogenic Ras mutant in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, using a portion of gyrase B or estrogen receptor, also resulted in activation of Raf-1. From these results, we conclude that membrane localization allows Ras to form a dimer, which is essential, although not sufficient, for Raf-1 activation.},

About 10{\%} of animals homozygous for the sur-1 mutation also display a specific and intriguing vulval cell lineage defect. In addition, the sur-1 mutation results in a cold-sensitive egg-laying defective phenotype and a partial larval lethal phenotype. We have cloned the sur-1 gene by DNA-mediated transformation and have shown that it encodes a protein similar in overall structure to mammalian MAP kinases (ERKs). The functional homology between Sur-1 MAP kinase and mammalian MAP kinases was also demonstrated by the ability of a rat ERK2 kinase to rescue the sur-1 mutant phenotypes. Genetic double-mutant analyses place sur-1 downstream of let-60 ras but upstream of lin-1 in the vulval signaling pathway. Our results provide further evidence for the extreme conservation of Ras-mediated signaling pathway between worms and humans and for the function of MAP kinases in cell signaling processes that control cell differentiation and animal development.},

Despite the identification of developmental processes in which invagination is a critical component of pattern formation, little is known regarding the underlying cellular and molecular details.  \emph{Caenorhabditis~elegans} vulval epithelial cells undergo morphological changes that generate an invagination through the formation of seven stacked rings. Here, we study the dynamics of ring formation during multivulva morphogenesis of a let-60/ras gain-of-function mutant as a model system to explore the cellular mechanisms that drive invagination. The behavior of individual cells was analyzed in a let-60/ras mutant by three-dimensional confocal microscopy. We showed that stereotyped cell fusion events occur within the rings that form functional and nonfunctional vulvae in a let-60/ras mutant. Expression of let-60/ras gain-of-function results in abnormal cell migration, ectopic cell fusion, and structural fate transformation. Within each developing vulva the anterior and posterior halves develop autonomously. Contrary to prevailing hypotheses which proposed three cell fates (1°, 2°, and 3°), we found that each of the seven rings is a product of a discrete structural pathway that is derived from arrays of seven distinct cell fates (A, B, C, D, E, F, and H). We have also shown how autonomous ring formation is the morphogenetic force that drives invagination of the vulva.},

We have cloned the let-60 gene, and shown that it encodes a gene product identical in 84{\%} of its first 164 amino acids to ras gene products from other vertebrate and invertebrate species. This conservation suggests that the let-60 product contains all the biochemical functions of ras proteins. Extrachromosomal arrays of let-60 ras DNA cause cell-type misspecification (extra vulval fates) phenotypically opposite to that caused by let-60 ras loss-of-function mutations (no vulval fates), and suppress the vulvaless phenotype of mutations in two other genes necessary for vulval induction. Thus, the level and pattern of let-60 ras expression may be under strict regulation; increase in let-60 ras activity bypasses or reduces the need for upstream genes in the vulval induction pathway. ? 1990.},

We have previously carried out screens for suppressors of activated Ras to identify factors that play critical roles in the regulation of the pathway. ku258 was isolated as a semidominant allele that suppresses the Multivulva phenotype caused by activated let-60 ras. Our genetic and molecular analyses indicate that ku258 is a gain-of-function allele resulting from two point mutations in the \emph{C.~elegans}  homolog of the transcriptional coactivator p300/CBP, cbp-1. Genetic data also suggest that cbp-1 may act downstream of the Ras signaling pathway, but not primarily downstream of the Wnt signaling pathway, to negatively regulate vulval cell fate specification. cbp-1 may function in concert with LIN-1, an Ets transcription factor family member that is one of the targets of MAPK. In vitro histone acetylation assays have revealed that together, the two point mutations cause a sevenfold increase in the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of recombinant CBP-1. To our knowledge, this is the only such HAT activity mutation isolated in a CBP/p300 family protein, and this mutation may define a negative role of the HAT activity in antagonizing Ras function in a specific developmental event.},

Because mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated by receptor tyrosine kinase pathways in vertebrate cells, we hypothesized that \emph{C.~elegans}  MAP kinase homologs may play a role in vulval induction. Two \emph{C.~elegans}  MAP kinase genes, mpk-1 and mpk-2 (mpk, MAP kinase), were cloned using degenerate oligonucleotide primers and PCR amplification; in parallel, genes involved in vulval induction were identified by screening for mutations that suppress the vulval defects caused by an activated let-60 ras gene. One such suppressor mutation is an allele of mpk-1. We used a new type of mosaic analysis to show that mpk-1 acts cell autonomously in the Pn.p cells. Our results show that mpk-1 plays an important functional role as an activator in ras-mediated cell signaling in vivo.},

In invertebrates, the proliferation of female germline stem cells is regulated by nutritional status. However, in mammals, the number of female germline stem cells is set early in development, with oocytes progressing through meiosis later in life. Mechanisms that couple later steps of oogenesis to environmental conditions remain largely undefined. We show that, in the presence of food, the DAF-2 insulin-like receptor signals through the RAS-ERK pathway to drive meiotic prophase I progression and oogenesis; in the absence of food, the resultant inactivation of insulin-like signaling leads to downregulation of the RAS-ERK pathway, and oogenesis is stalled. Thus, the insulin-like signaling pathway couples nutrient sensing to meiotic I progression and oocyte production in C. elegans, ensuring that oocytes are only produced under conditions favorable for the survival of the resulting zygotes.},

abstract = {The lipid-anchored small GTPase Ras is an important signaling node in mammalian cells. A number of observations suggest that Ras is laterally organized within the cell membrane, and this may play a regulatory role in its activation. Lipid anchors composed of palmitoyl and farnesyl moieties in H-, N-, and K-Ras are widely suspected to be responsible for guiding protein organization in membranes. Here, we report that H-Ras forms a dimer on membrane surfaces through a protein-protein binding interface. A Y64A point mutation in the switch II region, known to prevent Son of sevenless and PI3K effector interactions, abolishes dimer formation. This suggests that the switch II region, near the nucleotide binding cleft, is either part of, or allosterically coupled to, the dimer interface. By tethering H-Ras to bilayers via a membrane-miscible lipid tail, we show that dimer formation is mediated by protein interactions and does not require lipid anchor clustering. We quantitatively characterize H-Ras dimerization in supported membranes using a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, photon counting histogram analysis, time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, single-molecule tracking, and step photobleaching analysis. The 2D dimerization Kd is measured to be ∼1 × 10(3) molecules/µm(2), and no higher-order oligomers were observed. Dimerization only occurs on the membrane surface; H-Ras is strictly monomeric at comparable densities in solution. Analysis of a number of H-Ras constructs, including key changes to the lipidation pattern of the hypervariable region, suggest that dimerization is a general property of native H-Ras on membrane surfaces.},
