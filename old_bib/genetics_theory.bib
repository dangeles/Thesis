abstract = {The role of epistasis in the genetic architecture of quantitative traits is controversial, despite the biological plausibility that nonlinear molecular interactions underpin the genotype-phenotype map. This controversy arises because most genetic variation for quantitative traits is additive. However, additive variance is consistent with pervasive epistasis. In this Review, I discuss experimental designs to detect the contribution of epistasis to quantitative trait phenotypes in model organisms. These studies indicate that epistasis is common, and that additivity can be an emergent property of underlying genetic interaction networks. Epistasis causes hidden quantitative genetic variation in natural populations and could be responsible for the small additive effects, missing heritability and the lack of replication that are typically observed for human complex traits.},

The former are interested in understanding the developmental process; the emphasis is on identifying genes and studying their action and interaction. Typically, the genes have individually large effects and usually show substantial dominance and epistasis. The latter group are interested in quantitative phenotypes rather than individual genes. Quantitative traits are typically determined by many genes, usually with little dominance or epistasis. Furthermore, epistatic variance has minimum effect, since the selected population soon arrives at a state in which the rate of change is given by the additive variance or covariance. Thus, the breeder{\textquoteright}s custom of ignoring epistasis usually gives a more accurate prediction than if epistatic variance were included in the formulae. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society},

@article{Benzer1967,
abstract = {Complex as it is, much of the vast network of cellular functions has been success- fully dissected, on a microscopic scale, by the use of mutants in which one element is altered at a time. A similar approach may be fruitful in tackling the complex structures and events underlying behavior, using behavioral mutations to indicate modifications of the nervous system. Drosophila offers the same advantages to such a study as it did to classical genetics, namely, large numbers and short generation time, to which may now be added an enormous store of accumulated knowledge concerning the organism. Containing about 105 neurons, the fly's nervous system is roughly halfway, on a logarithmic scale, between a single neuron and the human brain, and the fly is possessed of a rich repertoire of behavior. The considerable literature on Drosophila behavior since Carpenter's 1905 paper' has recently been re- viewed by Manning.2 Multiple T-mazes and related devices have been used to fractionate populations according to their geotactic or phototactic responses, or spontaneous activity.3 This was pioneered by Hirsch and his colleagues,3 who started with a genetically heterogeneous pool obtained by mixing diverse wild strains and showed that pro- gressive selection yields strains showing hereditary changes in behavior. Such selection depends upon the recombination and additive effects of multiple genes that can prove quite difficult to disentangle. Since it is now possible to produce very high mutation rates in Drosophila, one can, instead, use an inbred strain and isolate mutants in which a behavioral change occurs by a single step, so that direct relationships between individual genes and the nervous system may be investigated. The method described here for fractionating populations is analogous to counter- current distribution,7 an eminently effective method of separating molecules from a mixture by their partition between two solvent phases. Using, instead, the relative preference of an organism for two behavioral alternatives, one obtains rapid, simultaneous measurements on many subjects. The present paper describes the procedure and the isolation of mutants showing changes in phototactic behavior.},

Eggs were collected from lethal-bearing lines and unhatched embryos from the lines in which 25{\%} or more of the embryos did not hatch (2843 lines) were dechorionated, fixed, cleared and scored under the compound microscope for abnormali-ties of the larval cuticle. A total of 272 mutants were iso-lated with phenotypes unequivocally distinguishable from wild-type embryos on the basis of the cuticular pattern. In complementation tests performed between mutants with similar phenotype, 48 loci were identified by more than one allele, the average being 5.4 alleles per locus. Comple-mentation of all other mutants was shown by 13 mutants. Members of the complementation groups were mapped by recombination analysis. No clustering of loci with similar phenotypes was apparent. From the distribution of the al-lele frequencies and the rate of discovery of new loci, it was estimated that the 61 loci represent the majority of embryonic lethal loci on the second chromosome yielding phenotypes recognizable in the larval cuticle.},

The maximum entropy model consistent with the observed pairwise correlations among justices' votes, an Ising spin glass, agrees quantitatively with the data. While all correlations (perhaps surprisingly) are positive, the effective pairwise interactions in the spin glass model have both signs, recovering the intuition that ideologically opposite justices negatively influence each another. Despite the competing interactions, a strong tendency toward unanimity emerges from the model, organizing the voting patterns in a relatively simple “energy landscape.” Besides unanimity, other energy minima in this landscape, or maxima in probability, correspond to prototypical voting states, such as the ideological split or a tightly correlated, conservative core. The model correctly predicts the correlation of justices with themajority and gives us ameasure of their influence on the majority decision. These results suggest that simple models, grounded in statistical physics, can capture essential features of collective decision making quantitatively, even in a complex political context.},

It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error.

It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the “percentage of causation,” which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Transcriptional control is central to many cellular processes, and, consequently, much effort has been devoted to understanding its underlying mechanisms. The organization of nucleosomes along promoter regions is important for this process, since most transcription factors cannot bind nucleosomal sequences and thus compete with nucleosomes for DNA access. This competition is governed by the relative concentrations of nucleosomes and transcription factors and by their respective sequence binding preferences. However, despite its importance, a mechanistic understanding of the quantitative effects that the competition between nucleosomes and factors has on transcription is still missing. Here we use a thermodynamic framework based on fundamental principles of statistical mechanics to explore theoretically the effect that different nucleosome organizations along promoters have on the activation dynamics of promoters in response to varying concentrations of the regulating factors. We show that even simple landscapes of nucleosome organization reproduce experimental results regarding the effect of nucleosomes as general repressors and as generators of obligate binding cooperativity between factors. Our modeling framework also allows us to characterize the effects that various sequence elements of promoters have on the induction threshold and on the shape of the promoter activation curves. Finally, we show that using only sequence preferences for nucleosomes and transcription factors, our model can also predict expression behavior of real promoter sequences, thereby underscoring the importance of the interplay between nucleosomes and factors in determining expression kinetics.},

In this study, we employ quantitative live imaging methods to assess the function of pairs of primary and shadow enhancers in the regulation of key patterning genes-knirps, hunchback, and snail-in developing Drosophila embryos. The knirps enhancers exhibit additive, sometimes even super-additive activities, consistent with classical gene fusion studies. In contrast, the hunchback enhancers function sub-additively in anterior regions containing saturating levels of the Bicoid activator, but function additively in regions where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid gradient. Strikingly sub-additive behavior is also observed for snail, whereby removal of the proximal enhancer causes a significant increase in gene expression. Quantitative modeling of enhancer–promoter interactions suggests that weakly active enhancers function additively while strong enhancers behave sub-additively due to competition with the target promoter.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We describe how statistical mechanics is part of the quantitative toolkit that is needed to respond to such data. The power of statistical mechanics is not limited to traditional physical and chemical problems and there are a host of interesting ways in which these ideas can be applied in biology.

@article{Angeles-Albores2018a,
	Abstract = {Transcriptome profiling quantitatively measures gene expression genome-wide. There is widespread interest in using transcriptomic profiles as phenotypes for epistasis analysis. Though epistasis measurements can be performed using individual transcripts, this results in many scores that must be interpreted independently. We developed a statistic that summarizes these measurements, simplifying analysis. Moreover, epistasis analysis has previously only been performed on cDNA extracted from single cells. We show that whole-organism RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to characterize interactions between genes. With the advent of genome engineering, mutants can be created easily in many organisms. Thus, phenotyping is now the rate-limiting step toward reconstructing interaction networks. Our work potentially represents a solution to this problem because RNA-seq is sensitive to a variety of genetic perturbations.RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is commonly used to identify genetic modules that respond to perturbations. In single cells, transcriptomes have been used as phenotypes, but this concept has not been applied to whole-organism RNA-seq. Also, quantifying and interpreting epistatic effects using expression profiles remains a challenge. We developed a single coefficient to quantify transcriptome-wide epistasis that reflects the underlying interactions and which can be interpreted intuitively. To demonstrate our approach, we sequenced four single and two double mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans. From these mutants, we reconstructed the known hypoxia pathway. In addition, we uncovered a class of 56 genes with HIF-1{\textendash}dependent expression that have opposite changes in expression in mutants of two genes that cooperate to negatively regulate HIF-1 abundance; however, the double mutant of these genes exhibits suppression epistasis. This class violates the classical model of HIF-1 regulation but can be explained by postulating a role of hydroxylated HIF-1 in transcriptional control.},

abstract = {Although transcriptomes have recently been used to perform epistasis analyses, they are not yet used to study intragenic function/structure relationships. We developed a theoretical framework to study allelic series using transcriptomic phenotypes. As a proof-of-concept, we apply our methods to an allelic series of dpy-22, a highly pleiotropic Caenorhabditis elegans gene orthologous to the human gene MED12, which encodes a subunit of the Mediator complex. Our methods identify functional regions within dpy-22 that modulate Mediator activity upon various genetic modules, including the Wnt and Ras modules.},
